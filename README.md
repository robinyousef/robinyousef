### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Robin, and I am in my 4th year at university studying economics, I have a great interest in statistics and data science/data analytics. The main languages I have been using and continuing to learn are Python and R. Another language I've used is Stata and I will be learning on using SQL soon. 

Most of my work currently displayed here will be/are from my coursework and assignments/projects I've done during my classes at school.
